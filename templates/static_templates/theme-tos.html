    information regarding your credit card or other payment instrument. You represent and warrant to NoticeAbility that such information is true and that you

        property owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner’s behalf.
    </li>

<p>
    <strong>Counter-Notice</strong>
    : If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the
    copyright owner, the copyright owner’s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content, you may send a written
    counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright Agent:
</p>

    If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, NoticeAbility will send a copy of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing
    that person that it may replace the removed content or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
    order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after
    receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole discretion.
</p>

    This Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration section is referred to in this Terms of Service as the “Arbitration Agreement.” You agree that any and all
    disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and NoticeAbility, whether arising out of or relating to this Terms of Service (including any

    claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. Further, this Arbitration Agreement does not preclude you from bringing issues to the attention of
    federal, state, or local agencies, and such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on your behalf. You agree that, by entering into this

        <strong>Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution</strong>
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    NoticeAbility is always interested in resolving disputes amicably and efficiently, and most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer’s
    satisfaction by emailing customer support at <a href="mailto:support@noticeability.org">support@noticeability.org</a> . If such efforts prove unsuccessful,
    a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to
    NoticeAbility should be sent to NoticeAbility Inc, PO Box 380617, Cambridge, MA, 02238
</p>
<p>
    (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If
    NoticeAbility and you do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or NoticeAbility may commence an
    arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by NoticeAbility or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator
    until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or NoticeAbility is entitled.
</p>

<p>
    <li type="a">
        <strong>Arbitration Procedures</strong>
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration will be conducted by a neutral arbitrator in accordance with the American Arbitration Association’s (“AAA”) rules and procedures, including the
    AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (collectively, the “AAA Rules”), as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. For information on
    the AAA, please visit its website, http://www.adr.org. Information about the AAA Rules and fees for consumer disputes can be found at the AAA’s consumer
    arbitration page, http://www.adr.org/consumer_arbitration. If there is any inconsistency between any term of the AAA Rules and any term of this Arbitration
    Agreement, the applicable terms of this Arbitration Agreement will control unless the arbitrator determines that the application of the inconsistent
    Arbitration Agreement terms would not result in a fundamentally fair arbitration. The arbitrator must also follow the provisions of these Terms of Service
    as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and
    arbitrability of this Arbitration Agreement. Although arbitration proceedings are usually simpler and more streamlined than trials and other judicial
    proceedings, the arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual under the Terms of Service
    and applicable law. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
</p>

<p>
    Unless NoticeAbility and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location for both parties with due
    consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, the determination shall be
    made by AAA. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, NoticeAbility agrees that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis
    of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds
    $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall
    issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.
</p>

<p>
    <li type="a">
        <strong>Costs of Arbitration</strong>
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees (collectively, the “Arbitration Fees”) will be governed by the AAA Rules, unless otherwise
    provided in this Arbitration Agreement. If the value of the relief sought is $75,000 or less, at your request, NoticeAbility will pay all Arbitration Fees.
    If the value of relief sought is more than $75,000 and you are able to demonstrate to the arbitrator that you are economically unable to pay your portion
    of the Arbitration Fees or if the arbitrator otherwise determines for any reason that you should not be required to pay your portion of the Arbitration
    Fees, NoticeAbility will pay your portion of such fees. In addition, if you demonstrate to the arbitrator that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive
    as compared to the costs of litigation, NoticeAbility will pay as much of the Arbitration Fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration
    from being cost-prohibitive. Any payment of attorneys’ fees will be governed by the AAA Rules.
</p>

<p>
    <li type="a">
        <strong>Confidentiality</strong>
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    All aspects of the arbitration proceeding, and any ruling, decision, or award by the arbitrator, will be strictly confidential for the benefit of all
    parties.
</p>

<p>
    <li type="a">
        <strong>Severability</strong>
    </li>
</p>
<p>
    If a court or the arbitrator decides that any term or provision of this Arbitration Agreement (other than the subsection (b) titled “Prohibition of Class
    and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” above) is invalid or unenforceable, the parties agree to replace such term or provision with a
    term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and
    this Arbitration Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. If a court or the arbitrator decides that any of the provisions of subsection (b) above
    titled “Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief” are invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Arbitration
    Agreement shall be null and void. The remainder of the Terms of Service will continue to apply.
</p>

<p>
    <li type="a">
        <strong>Future Changes to Arbitration Agreement</strong>
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
    Notwithstanding any provision in this Terms of Service to the contrary, NoticeAbility agrees that if it makes any future change to this Arbitration
    Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) while you are a user of the Services, you may reject any such change by sending NoticeAbility written
    notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will
    arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted these Terms of Service (or
    accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms of Service).
</p>

<p>
    <u><strong>Termination</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    You agree that NoticeAbility, in its sole discretion, may suspend or terminate your account (or any part thereof) or use of the Service and remove and
    discard any content within the Service, for any reason, including, without limitation, for lack of use or if NoticeAbility believes that you have violated
    or acted inconsistently with the letter or spirit of these Terms of Service. Any suspected fraudulent, abusive or illegal activity that may be grounds for
    termination of your use of Service, may be referred to appropriate law enforcement authorities. NoticeAbility may also in its sole discretion and at any
    time discontinue providing the Service, or any part thereof, with or without notice. You agree that any termination of your access to the Service under any
    provision of this Terms of Service may be effected without prior notice, and acknowledge and agree that NoticeAbility may immediately deactivate or delete
    your account and all related information and files in your account and/or bar any further access to such files or the Service. Further, you agree that
    NoticeAbility will not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your access to the Service.

</p>
<p>
    You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with any other user in connection with the Service and NoticeAbility will have no liability
    or responsibility with respect thereto. NoticeAbility reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become involved in any way with disputes between you
    and any other user of the Service.

<p>
    <u><strong>General</strong></u>
</p>
<p>
    These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and NoticeAbility and govern your use of the Service, superseding any prior agreements
    between you and NoticeAbility with respect to the Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate
    or third-party services, third-party content or third-party software. These Terms of Service will be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts without regard to its conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, as set forth above, you
    and NoticeAbility agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the Commonwealth of
    Massachusetts. The failure of NoticeAbility to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a waiver of such
    right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
    that the court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service
    remain in full force and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
    use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever barred. A printed
    version of this agreement and of any notice given in electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative proceedings based upon or relating to
    this agreement to the same extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents and records originally generated and maintained in printed
    form. You may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent of NoticeAbility, but NoticeAbility may assign or transfer this Terms of
    Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual
    effect. Notices to you may be made via either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to you of changes to these Terms of Service or
    other matters by displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
