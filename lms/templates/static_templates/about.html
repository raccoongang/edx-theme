The above categories of loss are intended to be severable.<br />8.4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Without prejudice to this Clause 8, We will not be responsible for virus damage caused by unauthorised copying of files. We will take reasonable steps to safeguard property at Customer sites. However, the Customer is ultimately responsible for such property.<br /><br />9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;General<br />9.1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Both parties shall comply with the Data Protection Act 1998.
