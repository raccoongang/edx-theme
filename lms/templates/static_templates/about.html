        <h1>About the World Scouting Learning Camp Project</h1>
        <p>World Scouting is strongly committed to support National Scout Organizations (NSOs) in the development of individual members, whether they are young people or adults who are motivated to learn because of the role they perform within Scouting or their interests.
        </p>
        <p>Technology is part of our everyday lives and has proven to provide cost-effective methods of communication. It also has a huge potential to support the development of organisations and individuals.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the efforts and effective short-term initiatives put in place by World Scouting for the past few years, mostly at the national level, there is yet a strategic approach to its use of new technologies in education. This project aims to address this issue.
        </p>
        <p>By putting forward this project, we hope to present World Scouting as a learning and up-to-date organisation that uses innovative approaches to support its Member Organizations in the development of their most valuable asset – people. Overall, we strongly believe in the effectiveness of this project and its potential contribution to the implementation of Vision 2023.
        </p>
        <p>The Learning Camp will be launched in early 2018, and will initially offer free and easy access to a growing number of online courses produced by World Scouting. It will be available anytime and anywhere, bringing people together in an online space.
