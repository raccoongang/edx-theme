        <h2>${_("Our Mission")}</h2>
        <p>${_("We have designed well-studied methodologies aiming to deliver top quality and professional training to meet today’s technology needs. We also contribute in providing the Egyptian market with technically qualified candidates—which consequently improves the overall level of technical capabilities and performance in today’s workforce. We have come to realize that investing massively on field experiments and researching about “how to train and how to learn” is certainly a smart investment that greatly nurtures the level of information delivery to trainees. That is why we have erected four “learning castles” built on supreme technical skills, sharp vision, accompanied with endless effort to improve. Our slogan cursively draws the picture of how YAT delivers the concept of knowledge; what we live to do is delivering: “An Art of Training”.")}</p>
        <h2>${_("Our Vision")}</h2>
        <p>${_("Being a part of today’s dynamic ICT arena, we have concluded how vital it is to stay on the top of the rapidly changing mercury-like-Industry. Consequently we have taken it upon ourselves to stay updated with top of the line technology releases. We also aim to outreach knowledge seekers outside of Egypt in the near future through expanding our presence internationally to shine our services light upon those whom strive for more refined forms of living—upholding industry international standards. Moreover, we have commenced putting together an e-learning project enabling those whom we cannot reach to use our virtual services to obtain the knowledge they are after. We simply look at our potential growth and expansion through the optimistic scope of “NO LIMITS”.")}</p>
        <h2>${_("Our Focus")}</h2>
        <p>${_("We believe that staying on the top is much harder than making it to the top. And that is how we have remained on the top of the training industry in Egypt and soon outside of Egypt as well. Our focus is to continue being on the top; simply because this is our philosophy of existence and our milestone to achieve.")}</p>
